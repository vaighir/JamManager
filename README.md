# JamManager

My end project for Programming Boot Camp Coders Lab.

It's supposed to help musicians find other people for jam sessions.

Only admin can acces "user management". A user can't joined twice the same jam session or his own jam session.
Admin's login is "admin" and users include "bad_influence", "satan" and "metal4eva". All passwords are "password".
